# 1530 Final Project: DoomSchooling

## What is DoomSchooling?

Doom Schooling is a web application designed to combat doom scrolling and procrastination in students.
With Doom Schooling, students are able to upload their course syllabi and get curated short form content based on their course topics.
This allow students to fulfill their scrolling needs while remaining productive and focused on their courses.
We plan to allow students to take knowledge checks based on their video history and update the recommendations algorithm 
to reflect content they might need extra support in.

The project includes a local database and a frontend served through HTML.



## First Step: Database Setup

Make sure json-server has been installed.
To start the local database, run the following command:

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

This will launch the database server at http://localhost:8000.



## Second Step: Running the Project Locally

To view the project in your browser:
	1.	Navigate to /src/html/home.html\ 
	2.	Open the file using Live Server (e.g., right-click → “Open with Live Server” in VS Code)\
