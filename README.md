# 1530 Final Project

This is the final project for course 1530. The project includes a local database and a frontend served through HTML file.



## First Step: Database Setup

Make sure json-server has been installed.
To start the local database, run the following command:

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

This will launch the database server at http://localhost:8000.



## Second Step: Running the Project Locally

To view the project in your browser:
	1.	Navigate to /src/html/home.html
	2.	Open the file using Live Server (e.g., right-click → “Open with Live Server” in VS Code)
