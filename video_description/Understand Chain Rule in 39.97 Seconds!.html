	<h1>What is Chain Rule? How to differentiate using the Chain Rule?
The Chain Rule is used for finding the derivative of composite functions. For this example, it is impossible to expand the brackets one by one as the exponent is extremely large. Therefore, the Chain Rule is used here for differentiation. We can separate the function into inner and outer function to make the differentiation easier. First, differentiate the outer function using power rule without modifying the inner function. Then, multiplying it with the derivative of the inner function.
