retrieve and convert relevant key words
Math
- run an example that gets the key words from the linked metadata
- should take relevant files and export to a separate txt

Order
- scan uploaded syllabus
- key words will be on the syllabus
- from those key words, something should parse and store them OR we do a comparison
between the two files

- have a file hardcoded with html link href's and metadata from those
- either run a comparison against the file or have a file scan for words
hardcoded into the other file

- from the related videos, create a separate txt/js with the related
htmls
- probably will have to be js bc those related videos feed into the live
server
- user should be able to choose class topic option
after uploading their page after uploading syllabus and get relevant vids
